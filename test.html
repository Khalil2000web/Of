12. OFFERINGS AND PURCHASES.
(A) THE WEBSITES MAY PERMIT YOU TO PURCHASE CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, INCLUDING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE WEBSITES (“OFFERINGS”). THE OFFERINGS ARE INTENDED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. PARKWOOD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO SELL ANY OFFERINGS TO YOU IF IT REASONABLY APPEARS TO US THAT YOU INTEND TO RESELL SUCH OFFERINGS. WE FURTHER RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT QUANTITIES OF OFFERINGS PURCHASED BY EACH USER OR TO REFUSE TO PROVIDE ANY USER WITH THE OFFERINGS. ORDERS OF SPECIAL OFFERINGS (INCLUDING LIMITED EDITION AND PRE-ORDER OFFERINGS) MAY CONTAIN ADDITIONAL TERMS, WHICH WILL BE PROVIDED FOR EACH SUCH OFFERING. PLEASE READ THE TERMS LISTED FOR EACH OFFERING ON THE APPLICABLE PAGE OF THE WEBSITES CAREFULLY BEFORE PLACING YOUR ORDER.
(B) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE WITH REGARDS TO THE PURCHASE OF OFFERINGS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CREDIT CARD, PAYPAL, OR OTHER PAYMENT INFORMATION, IS ACCURATE, CURRENT AND COMPLETE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDE TO US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CREDIT CARD YOU PROVIDE WHEN COMPLETING A TRANSACTION. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AND IN OUR SOLE AND COMPLETE DISCRETION, TO (I) DISCONTINUE, MODIFY, OR LIMIT THE AVAILABLE QUANTITY OF ANY OFFERINGS, AND (II) REFUSE TO ALLOW ANY USER TO PURCHASE ANY OFFERING OR DELIVER SUCH OFFERINGS TO A USER OR A USER DESIGNATED ADDRESS. WHEN YOU PURCHASE OFFERINGS, YOU (A) AGREE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR SUCH OFFERINGS AS SET FORTH ON THE APPLICABLE PAGE OF THE WEBSITES, AND ALL SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PURCHASE (THE “FULL PURCHASE AMOUNT”), AND (B) AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE FULL PURCHASE AMOUNT. THE WEBSITES MAY ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE OFFERINGS AND DESIGNATE THEM TO BE DELIVERED OR PROVIDED AT A FUTURE DATE. IN SUCH INSTANCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE MAY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE FULL PURCHASE AMOUNT ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE, RATHER THAN ON THE ULTIMATE DATE OF DELIVERY OR PROVISION OF THE APPLICABLE OFFERING. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, ALL CURRENCY REFERENCES ARE IN U.S. DOLLARS. ALL FEES AND CHARGES ARE PAYABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PAYMENT TERMS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THE FEE OR THE CHARGE BECOMES PAYABLE. PAYMENT CAN BE MADE BY CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR THROUGH PAYPAL OR OTHER MEANS THAT WE MAY MAKE AVAILABLE. ORDERS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED UNTIL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED IN FULL, AND ANY HOLDS ON YOUR ACCOUNT BY PAYPAL OR ANY OTHER PAYMENT PROCESSOR ARE SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
(C) WE MAY OFFER CERTAIN PROMOTIONAL CODES, REFERRAL CODES, DISCOUNT CODES, COUPON CODES OR SIMILAR OFFERS (“PROMOTIONAL CODES”) THAT MAY BE REDEEMED FOR DISCOUNTS ON FUTURE OFFERINGS, OR OTHER FEATURES OR BENEFITS RELATED TO THE WEBSITES, SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT PARKWOOD ESTABLISHES. YOU AGREE THAT PROMOTIONAL CODES: (I) MUST BE USED IN A LAWFUL MANNER; (II) MUST BE USED FOR THE INTENDED AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE; (III) MAY NOT BE DUPLICATED, SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY MANNER, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY YOU TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC (WHETHER POSTED TO A PUBLIC FORUM, COUPON COLLECTING SERVICE, OR OTHERWISE), UNLESS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY PARKWOOD; (IV) MAY BE DISABLED OR HAVE ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS APPLIED TO THEM BY PARKWOOD AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON WITHOUT LIABILITY TO PARKWOOD; (V) MAY ONLY BE USED PURSUANT TO THE SPECIFIC TERMS THAT PARKWOOD ESTABLISHES FOR SUCH PROMOTIONAL CODE; (VI) ARE NOT VALID FOR CASH OR OTHER CREDITS OR POINTS; AND (VII) MAY EXPIRE PRIOR TO YOUR USE.
(D) TANGIBLE AND/OR DIGITAL GIFT CARDS CONTAINING STORED MONEY VALUE MAY BE OFFERED BY US FOR THE PURCHASE OF OFFERINGS (“GIFT CARDS”). PARKWOOD DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO YOUR GIFT CARD BALANCE AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR GIFT CARD BALANCE, OR ALTERATION, THEFT, OR DESTRUCTION OF A GIFT CARD OR GIFT CARD CODE THAT RESULTS FROM ANY ACTION BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY. WE MAY SUSPEND OR PROHIBIT USE OF YOUR GIFT CARD IF YOUR GIFT CARD OR GIFT CARD CODE HAS BEEN REPORTED LOST OR STOLEN, OR IF WE BELIEVE YOUR GIFT CARD BALANCE IS BEING USED SUSPICIOUSLY, FRAUDULENTLY, OR IN AN OTHERWISE UNAUTHORIZED MANNER. IF YOUR GIFT CARD CODE STOPS WORKING, YOUR ONLY REMEDY IS FOR US TO ISSUE YOU A REPLACEMENT GIFT CARD CODE. BY PURCHASING A GIFT CARD, YOU AGREE AND REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO PARKWOOD THAT YOUR USE OF THE GIFT CARD WILL COMPLY WITH THESE COMBINED TERMS AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. GIFT CARDS CANNOT BE USED TO PURCHASE OTHER GIFT CARDS, RELOADED, RESOLD, USED FOR PAYMENT OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, USED FOR UNAUTHORIZED MARKETING, SWEEPSTAKES, ADVERTISING, OR OTHER PROMOTIONAL PURPOSES, REDEEMED FOR MORE THAN FACE VALUE, TRANSFERRED FOR VALUE, REDEEMED FOR CASH, OR RETURNED FOR A CASH REFUND (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW). GIFT CARDS DO NOT EXPIRE, AND PARKWOOD WILL NOT ASSESS A SERVICE FEE, INACTIVITY FEE OR DORMANCY FEE WITH RESPECT TO A GIFT CARD.
(E) PARKWOOD MAY, AT ANY TIME, REVISE OR CHANGE THE PRICING, AVAILABILITY, SPECIFICATIONS, CONTENT, DESCRIPTIONS OR FEATURES OF ANY OFFERINGS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS WE CAN IN OUR DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE OFFERINGS, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT OFFERING DESCRIPTIONS ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE. THE INCLUSION OF ANY OFFERINGS FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE WEBSITES AT A PARTICULAR TIME DOES NOT IMPLY OR WARRANT THAT THE OFFERINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY OTHER TIME. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE PRICES FOR OFFERINGS DISPLAYED ON THE WEBSITES AT ANY TIME, AND TO CORRECT PRICING ERRORS THAT MAY INADVERTENTLY OCCUR (AND TO CANCEL ANY ORDERS IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION THAT WERE PURCHASED WITH PRICING ERRORS). ALL SUCH CHANGES SHALL BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING OF SUCH NEW OFFERING PRICES TO THE WEBSITES AND/OR UPON MAKING THE CUSTOMER AWARE OF THE PRICING ERROR. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE AN INTERNATIONAL USER (E.G. RESIDING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), YOU MUST DETERMINE, PAY, COLLECT, REMIT AND REPORT TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITY THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF ALL EXPORT AND/OR IMPORT TAXES OR DUTIES PAYABLE UPON EXPORT OF THE OFFERING FROM ITS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND IMPORT INTO YOUR COUNTRY.
(F) BY PLACING AN ORDER FOR AN OFFERING, YOU CONSENT TO RECEIVING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS FROM BEYONCÉ AND/OR PARKWOOD. THESE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS MAY INCLUDE NOTICES ABOUT APPLICABLE FEES AND CHARGES, TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING OR RELATED TO OUR WEBSITES. THESE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE PART OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BEYONCÉ AND PARKWOOD AND YOU RECEIVE THEM AS PART OF YOUR OFFERING ORDER.
(G) ONCE WE RECEIVE YOUR ORDER FOR AN OFFERING, WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH AN ORDER CONFIRMATION. YOUR RECEIPT OF AN ORDER CONFIRMATION, HOWEVER, DOES NOT SIGNIFY OUR ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR ORDER, NOR DOES IT CONSTITUTE CONFIRMATION OF OUR OFFER TO SELL; WE ARE SIMPLY CONFIRMING THAT WE RECEIVED YOUR ORDER. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME AFTER RECEIVING YOUR ORDER TO ACCEPT OR DECLINE YOUR ORDER FOR ANY REASON AND IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION MAY BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO OUR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY ORDER. IF WE CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN BILLED, THEN WE WILL REFUND THE BILLED AMOUNT. ORDER PROCESSING MAY TAKE BETWEEN ONE (1) TO SEVEN (7) DAYS (NOT INCLUDING WEEKENDS OR HOLIDAYS) AND SOMETIMES LONGER, DEPENDING UPON VOLUME OF ORDERS. TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS FOR ANY PURCHASES OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS PASS TO YOU UPON OUR DELIVERY TO OUR CARRIER. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST, STOLEN, OR DAMAGED SHIPMENTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE COMBINED TERMS, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR FILING ANY CLAIMS WITH THE APPLICABLE CARRIER FOR DAMAGED AND/OR LOST SHIPMENTS. USERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ADDITIONAL SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES TO HAVE ANY ORDER RE-SHIPPED. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SHIP PARTIAL ORDERS (AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO YOU), AND THE PORTION OF ANY ORDER THAT IS PARTIALLY SHIPPED MAY BE CHARGED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. ALL ORDERS ARE SHIPPED USING ONE OF OUR THIRD PARTY COURIERS. ONLINE TRACKING MAY BE AVAILABLE AT OUR COURIER’S WEBSITE (FOR EXAMPLE, FEDEX), THOUGH WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES REGARDING ITS AVAILABILITY BECAUSE IT IS NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL. PARKWOOD MAY PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE, AND DELIVERIES MAY BE SCHEDULED FOR A SPECIFIED ARRIVAL, BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE DELIVERY BY ANY SPECIFIC DATE OR TIME. ALTHOUGH PARKWOOD WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORT TO MEET ESTIMATED DATES, DELIVERY OF OFFERINGS MAY TAKE MORE OR LESS TIME THAN ESTIMATED AND PARKWOOD DISCLAIMS ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM A DELAY IN ARRIVAL OR DELIVERY. REFUSED PACKAGES WILL BE CONSIDERED FORFEITED AND ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REFUND OR CREDIT.
